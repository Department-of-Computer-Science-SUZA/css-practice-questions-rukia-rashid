  <p>Girls, I think, existed before the internet. Louisa May Alcott called them “Little Women,” and 18th-century painters depicted them as elderly children. The ’80s had the geriatric Golden Girls, and the ’90s had the 20-year-old Spice Girls, which is to say: Some of our most famous girls were never girls at all. These were women who decided—with all their adult knowledge—to revisit the camaraderie of girlhood. Because a girl is never a woman, but a woman can, of course, be both. And over the past 12 months, it feels like a similar sense of yearning has permeated culture. There was the resurgence of Barbie as a popular protagonist; there were Taylor Swift friendship bracelets; there was a Sofia Coppola film; and there was the rise of Sandy Liang and all her bow-festooned designs, dovetailing with a mainstreaming of school shoes and the omnipresence of TikTok’s girl trends.</p>
